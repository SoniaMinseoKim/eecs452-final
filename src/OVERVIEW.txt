Source Code Overview

This src folder is mainly divided into three sub-folders that correspond to the 
three main modules in our project - calibration, detection, and base station.

Following are brief descriptions of the main source files in each sub-folder.
The rest of the files are either configuration files or esp32-espressif modules
you need for the code to run on your esp32.

Calibration:
1. calibration.py - generates camera matrices for each camera by detecting the 
                    7x7 chessboard in view and stores them into .npz file
2. jpeg_live_image.py - continuously receives JPEG image data over UDP and 
                        saves the images to files in a specified directory

Detection:
1. main.c - captures images from esp camera, detects blobs (bright retroreflective markers), 
            and transmits windowed image over UDP.

Base station:
1. 

To reproduce this project, you will follow the specific order above.

More details about how to run the code can be found in USAGE.txt
