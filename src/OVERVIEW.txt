Source Code Overview

This src folder is mainly divided into three sub-folders that correspond to the 
three main modules in our project - calibration, detection, and base station.

Following are brief descriptions of the main source files in each sub-folder.
The rest of the files are either configuration files or esp32-espressif modules
you need for the code to run on your esp32.

Calibration:
1. calibration.py - generates camera matrices for each camera by detecting the 
                    7x7 chessboard in view and stores them into .npz file
2. jpeg_live_image.py - continuously receives JPEG image data over UDP and 
                        saves the images to files in a specified directory

Detection:
1. main.c - captures images from esp camera, detects blobs (bright retroreflective markers), 
            and transmits windowed image over UDP.

Base station:
1. src/main.rs - base-station driver methods. Responsible for receiving UDP packets, reconstructing data, performing April tag detection, and delegating tasks to the ekf and visualization methods.
2. src/ekf.rs - Rust definition of extended kalman filter and corresponding thread pool.
3. src/visualization.rs - visualizes reconstructed 3D points with KISS3D library.

To reproduce this project, you will follow the specific order above.

More details about how to run the code can be found in USAGE.txt
