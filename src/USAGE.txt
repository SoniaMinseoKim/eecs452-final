Usage Tutorial

The ESP32-CAMs can be flashed according to the User Guide in INSTALLATION.TXT with idf.py build, flash, and monitor.

CALIBRATION
The ESPs can be flashed with calibration code. The receiving server can be configured through idf.py menuconfig -> User Configuration -> IPv4 Address. WiFi must be configured through Example Connection Configuration, and "Obtain IPv6 address" should not be checked off. The images will be sent to this address and port, as can be adjusted in the src/jpeg_live_image.py file. Each camera should have a different CAM_ID, as in src/calibration/main/jpeg_transmit.c. The JPEG stream can be monitored through the src/calibration_image folder, and the image-X.jpg files correspond to each CAM_ID. num_cameras must also be configured in calibration.py. To find camera extrinsics, run calibration.py. The corresponding calibration_results.npz file stores the arrays of camera data and must be fed into the base-station.

DETECTION
The ESPs can be flashed with detection data. As with calibration, the receiving server can be configured through idf.py menuconfig -> User Configuration -> IPv4 Address. WiFi must be configured through Example Connection Configuration, and "Obtain IPv6 address" should not be checked off. However, each IPv4 PORT must ALSO be different for each camera, as this is how the base-station labels each camera. 

BASE-STATION
The base-station can be run through Rust cargo run.
